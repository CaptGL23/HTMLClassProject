      <hr>
      <h1>Growing Up</h1>
        <p>I am originally from Northern Ohio, about 30 minutes from Cleveland, Ohio.<br>I started playing baseball when I was 3 years old and continued playing until<br>I was 17. A lot of my free time growing up consisted of skateboarding,<br>drawing, playing video games, and playing basketball for fun.</p>
      <h1>Adult Life</h1>
        <p>I met my wife when we were in high school and now we have been together<br>almost 10 years and have 3 beautiful children. After high school, I attended<br><em>The University of Toledo</em> to get a Bachelor's degree in astrophysics. At the<br>same time, I was attending the Reserve Officers' Training Corps (ROTC) at<br><em>Bowling Green State University</em>. With having a wife and child, I couldn't<br>afford to stay in school so my wife and I decided it was best if I enlisted<br>in the Air Force and worked towards a degree. Six years later and here we<br>are, finally working towards that degree.</p>

      <h1>My Hobbies</h1>
        <p>Gaming is really my only hobby, outside of work and family.<br>One of the games I normally play is <strong>League of Legends</strong>.<br>When I can't play, I normally watch professional play.<br>It is football season and I do enjoy keeping up with my teams,<br><strong><em>The Pittsburgh Steelers</em></strong> and <strong><em>The Cleveland Browns</em></strong></p>
